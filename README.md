## Introduction
Project peristerónas was created to aid both students and teacher for achieving a
clear overview for deadlines and projects that need to be submitted.

There's a separate functionality depending on if you're logged in as a teacher or as a student.
For student the main functionality is to have a user-friendly interface to submit projects and check the correctness of their submissions.

When a teacher is logged in he can get an overview of the projects he assigned and check how many students already
handed in a correct solution for example. It's also possible the edit the project and to grade projectsb in peristerónas' interface.
