## Introduction
Project peristerónas was created to aid both teachers and students in achieving a
clear overview of deadlines and projects that need to be submitted.

There's a separate functionality depending on if you're logged in as a teacher or as a student.
For students the main functionality is to have a user-friendly interface to submit projects and check the correctness of their submissions.

When a teacher is logged in they can get an overview of the projects he assigned and check how many students have already
handed in a correct solution for example. It's also possible to edit the project and to grade projects in peristerónas' interface.
