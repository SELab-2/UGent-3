# Project upload guide
A teacher can upload a new project of their course by going to the url ```projects/create``` where they will need to fill out data corresponding to the project they want to upload.

For the first 3 fields of the form, you just need to fill in the title you want for the project, the description and select the course you want the project to be for. The course selection is in a dropdown menu where you can see all the courses that you are the teacher of.

Next there's a calender where you need to choose deadlines of the project, every deadline can have a description and a timestamp.
As seen in the image above you'll see a table of every deadline you added. If you want to remove a deadline, simply click on the calender date itself and click the remove icon.

Then there is a checkbox that contains the value visible for students, this dictates if a project should be immediately visible on upload or not.
When the box is ticked, the value will be set to true and the project will be visible on upload.

To upload assignment files you can use the given file uploader. Files must be uploaded as a .zip file.
You can drag & drop your files or click the button and when the files are uploaded, you get a table that shows which files are in the selected .zip file.

You can specify file restrictions for submissions of students with the above part of the form.
There you can choose what you need the filename to start with, for example.

If you're familiar with regex you can also use the advanced mode to specify file restrictions. If you don't know how to use regex, but are still interested in using this functionality, you can consult the following [cheatsheet](https://cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/regular-expressions/).

Finally there's the dropdown menu for the runner.
The explanation for this menu can be found in this [section](/docs/category/evaluators)
