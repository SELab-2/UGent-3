# Project upload guide
A teacher can upload a new project of his course by going to the url ```projects/create``` where he will need to fill in data corresponding to the project he wants to upload.
![Projectform](/img/project_form_1.png)

The first 3 fields are rather straightforward, you just need to fill in the title you want for the project, the description and select the course you want the project for. The course selection is in a dropdown where you see all the courses you can see all the courses you are teacher of.

Next theres a calender where you need to choose deadlines of the project, every deadline can have a deadline and a timestamp.
As seen in the image above you'll see a table of every deadline you added, if you want to remove a deadline simply click on the calender date itself and click the remove icon.

Then there is a checkbox that contains the value visible for students, this dictated if a project should be immediately visible on upload or not.

To upload assignment files you can use the given file uploader, it must be a .zip file.
You can drag & drop your files or click the button and when the files are uploaded, you get a table that gives an oversight for which files are in the zipfile.

You can specify file restrictions for submissions of students with the above part of the form.
There you can choose with what you need the filename to start for example.

If you're familiar with regexes you can also go in the advanced mode to specify file restrictions. If you're don't know how to use regex but are interested in still using this functionality you can consult follow [cheatsheet](https://cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/regular-expressions/).

Finally there's the dropdown for the runner.
But those are explained in this [section](/docs/category/evaluators)
